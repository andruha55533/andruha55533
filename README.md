Hi, my name is Andrew, a ukrainian frontend developer looking for new possibilities to learn new about frameworks and languages such as HTML/JS/CSS and React, Angular, Vue. I began getting involved in programming since 2018, the first language i learned was Python. I reset my coding progress in 2022 by obtaining a vast potential to intensely learn JS, C++ and PHP. Back in 2022 when i had applied for the university, I began learning C++. Now I'm perfecting my coding skills by creating various projects, repositories and attending the coding courses.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: enhancing my programming skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS/CSS/HTML, React.js ,C++, PHP
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beside the programming language, I fluently speak 3 languages such as English,Ukrainian and russian
